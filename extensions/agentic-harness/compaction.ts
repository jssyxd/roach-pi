This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like file names, full code snippets, function signatures, file edits
   - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness.
${phaseSection}

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Include full code snippets where applicable and a summary of why each file is important.
4. Errors and Fixes: List all errors encountered and how they were fixed. Include user feedback.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All User Messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the user's feedback and changing intent.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks you have been explicitly asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request. Include file names and code snippets.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step directly in line with the user's most recent explicit request. Include direct quotes from the most recent conversation to prevent task drift.
